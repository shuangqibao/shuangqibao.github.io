### Overview
This project studies discrete-time **dynamic allocation problems** with non-Markovian and possibly dependent filtrations.  
The focus is on systems where the number of active projects (the dimension) itself evolves stochastically over time.

### Contributions
- Formulated the **discrete-time dynamic allocation problem** with independent/dependent filtrations.  
- Developed a **new stochastic-dimension formulation** allowing arms to appear or vanish randomly.  
- Currently focusing on deriving the **optimal allocation and stopping strategy** under general information structures.
