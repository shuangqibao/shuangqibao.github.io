**Period:** May 2022 â€“ Jan 2023  

### Overview
This project focused on applying **data mining** and **behavioral analytics** techniques to educational data at scale.  
The goal was to improve the feedback loop for programming courses and automate the generation of summary reports for faculty.

### Contributions
- Co-authored an unpublished manuscript on **CodeAssist**, an automated feedback system for programming courses.  
- Built a **Python pipeline** to automatically collect, parse, and clean large-scale homework-submission logs, transforming raw data into analysis-ready tables and significantly reducing manual work.  
- Designed a **reproducible analytics framework** for course-level metadata, enabling cross-course comparisons and automated summary reporting for instructors.
