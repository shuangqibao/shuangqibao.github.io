### Overview
This literature review project synthesizes classical and modern works on **explicitly solvable optimal stopping** and **stochastic control problems**.

### Contributions
- Reconstructed omitted proofs and filled in analytical gaps from five key references in the literature.  
- Produced detailed **research notes and proof verifications** for explicit-solution problems in stochastic control.  
- Connected these examples to the general theory of **variational inequalities** and **free-boundary problems**.
