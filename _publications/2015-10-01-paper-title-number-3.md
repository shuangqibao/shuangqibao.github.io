### Overview
This project extends the Bellman equation and dynamic programming principle to multi-stage sequential testing problems involving multiple independent signals. The goal is to identify the globally optimal switching and stopping strategy.

### Contributions
- Extended the Bellman equation to the **two-stage** sequential testing problem.  
- Proved the **equality between multi-stage and single-stage value functions** using local analysis of the Bellman recursion.  
- Generalized the framework to **N-signal systems**, deriving the optimal stopping rule and global optimal strategy.
